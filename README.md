# Convelio Japan: Operational Logic Prototype

**A strategic Python framework translating Japanese high-context market friction into executable digital logic.**

This repository demonstrates how complex regulatory requirements and strict quality standards can be integrated into Convelio's upstream logistics operations.

## 🎯 Strategic Objective
To mitigate legal friction, prevent customs delays, and eliminate aesthetic packaging defects for Japan-bound shipments *before* they leave European warehouses.

## ⚙️ Core Modules (Single-Page Dashboard)

### 1. 🏛️ Export Compliance & Risk Radar (Upstream)
Automates the detection of Japan-specific regulatory bottlenecks:
* **The "50-Year Rule":** Flags artworks mandating an Agency for Cultural Affairs review.
* **CITES Violations:** Detects regulated materials to prevent fatal customs seizures.

### 2. 🔒 Digital Quality Gate (Warehouse Execution)
Digitizes Japanese aesthetic standards into binary logic for warehouse staff:
* **Gap Tolerance:** Enforces a `< 0.5cm` internal gap rule to meet Tier-1 gallery expectations.
* **Visual Presentation:** Blocks label generation if photo evidence or outer tape alignment fails to meet SLA.

## 🛠️ How to Run Locally
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`streamlit run app.py`
